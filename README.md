A feed-forward network simulation for a school presentation. The network has 2 inputs a single output and a two-neuron hidden layer. The aim is to control a simple Flappy Bird-style game.

## How to open
This repository is a [Unity3D](https://unity3d.com) project. After installing and opening Unity you can open
the project by opening it in the project selection screen. Unity auto-generates the `.sln` and `.csproj` files
that are required to edit the code in [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com) or any compatible IDE (I used [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider)).

## Controls

1, 2, 3, 4, 5 - Control simulation speed

R - Restart simulation
